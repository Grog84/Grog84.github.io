# Welcome!!!

Hello everyone,

and welcome to my GitHub page. My name is **Fabio Brigidi**. I'm a Ph.D in Physics who recently moved to video games programming. In this GitHub page you will mostly find **Unity3D** projects and other programming exercises of various nature. If there is anything you'd like to scrap from my code, go ahead and feel free to do it. If there is anything you'd like to ask me, please just write and I'll try my best to reach you :)

My ultimate goal would be to maintain this page in order to sort and keep the repositories I am creating in order, but I'm not the best at it.. that's why at the end of the page you will find a link to all my public repositories.


## Unity3D Games

### [HOME (Under development)](https://github.com/Grog84/BigOne)

Home is a game developed inside the Digital Bros Game Academy in a frame of collaboration with [Video Games Without Borders](http://vgwb.org/) (Pls try to find the time to have a look at their website, it really is an awesome project!!!)

Home is a 3D story driven stealth game, describing the transition of a normal and familiar place into a dangerous and hostile environment, leaving no other choice but to flee.
The protagonists of the story are a mother and her child trying to survive in an hostile environment.

My main contributions to the project are:
- A Scriptable Objects based state machine system used by the Game Manager and the playable characters.
- A map editor tool used in order to place props in the scene.
- The AI of the guards and NPCs. The guards AI was implemented in the early stages of the project as a state machine using a Scriptable Object implementation (still present, even if not used), but it was later modified using the behaviour trees. In the project it also possible to find a tool for the creation of the trees.
- FMOD implementation of the 3D audio and dynamic music, including a terrain texture reading script that modifies the footstep sounds according to the surface.

### [Maze Wielders](https://github.com/Grog84/LabirintoMagico.git)

Maze Wielders is a one month school project developed inside the Digital Bros Game Academy. It is a 2D turn based, multiplayer game that got its inspiration from the notorious board game **Labyrinth**. As in the board game, in Maze Wielders it is possible to slide the tiles forming the board in order to create new paths, but it is also possible to rotate them and to insert traps for the other players (that will become invisible and is up to them to remember where they are!) The goal of the game is to be the first player to grab the crystal at the center of the board and bring it to the base, causing a continuous shifting of the playstyle from an everyone off against each other to an everyone off against the crystal carrier.

My main contributions to the project are:
- The turn manager
- The lerping tiles system
- The trap activation
- UI animation

### [C.U.R.C](https://github.com/Grog84/GGJ18)

C.U.R.C (Clumsy Ufo Ray Controller) is a game realized during the 2018 Global Game Jam in Milan and the proud winner of the **WTF!** award :P
In C.U.R.C you play the role of a nasty alien who's making use of his U.F.O special ray in order to take control of a poor scientist and mess up his secret base. Very soon things are going wild! Humorous sounds and messy characters creates hilarious situations and makes the game worth a try.

### [Don Cosciotte](https://github.com/Grog84/DBGAGameJam)

Don Cosciotte is a game created in occasion of the Digital Bros Game Jam. The game is a variation on the typical tower defense theme, mixing it with a little **Lemmings** touch. In Don Cosciotte you play as an invisible entity helping the main character, a worthless and dumb no-one, on his way to glory: swiping away traps and enemies you have to protect him while he crosses the level, but be aware that his way of thinking could be not that linear and easy to read. The game is filled with humorous touches, like shepherdess monsters, dumb sounds and rolling heads :)

### [Shaman Queen](https://github.com/Grog84/Shaman)

Shaman Queen is a three weeks project trying to recreate the same feeling of the 80s arcade games. Shaman Queen is an environmental puzzle game, where you play as shaman who can absorb the elements and move them around the map trying to overcome the obstacles. At the beginning of the game you find out that your power crystals were stolen leaving you almost powerless, with the only ability of moving earth. Recuperate your crystals and regain your powers in order to get your revenge!
