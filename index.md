## Welcome!!!

Hello everyone,

and welcome to my GitHub page. My name is *Fabio Brigidi*. I'm a Ph.D in Physics who recently moved to video games programming. In this GitHub page you will mostly find *Unity3D* projects and oher programming exercises of various nature. If there is anything you'd like to scrap from my code, go ahead and feel free to do it. If there is anything you'd like to ask me, please just write and I'll try my best to reach you :)

My ultimate goal would be to maintain this page in order to sort and keep the repositories I am creating in order, but I'm not the best at it.. taht's why at the end of the page you will find a link to all my public repositories.


### Unity3D Games

## HOME (Under development)

Home is a game developed inside the Digital Bros Game Academy in a frame of collaboration with [Video Games Without Borders](http://vgwb.org/) (Pls try to find the time to have a look at their website, it really is an awesome project!!!)

The game is a story driven stealth game, aiming to describe the terrible transition of anyone's home from a normal and familiar place into a dangerous and hostile environment, leaving no other coiche than to fleeing.

My main contrbution to the project were:
- A Scriptable Objects based state machine system used by the Game Manager and the playable characters.
- A map editor tool used in order to place props in the scene.
- The AI of the guards and NPCs. The guards AI was implemented in the early stages of the project as a state machine usng a Scriptable Object implementation (still present, even if not used), but it was later modified using the behaviour trees. In the project it also possible to find a tool for the creation of the trees.
- FMOD implementation of the 3D audio and dynamic music, including a terrain texture reading script that modifies the footstep sounds according to the surface.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Grog84/Grog84.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
